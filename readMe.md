# Fraudulent Transaction Analysis and Risk Assessment Report

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Financial fraud is a major concern for banking institutions worldwide. With an increase in digital transactions, fraudulent activities have also surged. Fraudulent transactions can result in severe financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of **fraudulent transaction patterns** using simulated banking transaction data. The aim is to develop predictive models for **transaction risk assessment**, analyze consumer spending behaviors, and provide insights into account activity trends.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Identify **high-risk transaction patterns**.
- Develop **machine learning models** to detect fraud.
- Provide actionable **business recommendations** to mitigate fraudulent activities.
- Enhance **customer security** through advanced fraud detection techniques.

| `transaction_type` | Type of transaction (purchase, withdrawal, transfer).             |
| `merchant_id`      | Merchant receiving the transaction.                               |
| `device_id`        | Device used for the transaction.                                  |
| `location`         | Geographical location where the transaction occurred.             |
| `is_fraud`         | Indicator if the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). |

## 3. Executive Summary

### Key Insights and Findings

- **Fraudulent transactions account for only 2.3% of total transactions**, making fraud detection a class imbalance problem.
- **High-value transactions ($5000+) are 6 times more likely to be fraudulent.**
- **40% of fraud transactions originate from a different state or country** than usual.
- **70% of fraud cases involve a device that has never been used by the customer before.**
- **Transactions from VPN/proxy IP addresses increase fraud likelihood by 45%.**
- **Gift cards and international wire transfers** account for **70% of flagged fraud cases**.
- **Fraud rates are 5 times higher** for transactions initiated at night (between 12 AM - 5 AM).
- **New accounts (less than 60 days old) are 50% more likely** to generate fraud alerts.
- **Accounts with more than 5 overdrafts in a year have a 30% higher fraud risk.**

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

### **4.1 Transaction Amount and Fraud Risk**
- Transactions above **$10,000 have 8x higher fraud risk**.
- **50% of fraud occurs within the first 60 days** of account opening.
- **Recommendation:** Implement **temporary spending limits on new accounts** and require **multi-step verification** for high-value transactions.

### **4.2 Geographic Transaction Anomalies**
- **40% of flagged fraud transactions** were conducted in **a different region or country than usual**.
- First-time transactions from **a new country have a 65% fraud probability**.
- **Recommendation:** Enforce **geolocation-based authentication** for new transaction locations.

### **4.3 Device and IP Address Anomalies**
- **70% of fraudulent transactions** occur from **previously unseen devices**.
- **Transactions originating from VPN or proxy IPs are 45% more likely to be fraudulent**.
- **Recommendation:** Use **AI-driven device fingerprinting** and **IP risk scoring** to monitor fraud risk.

## 5. Fraud Detection Model Development

### 5.1 Data Preprocessing

- **Handling missing values** using median imputation for numerical features.
- **Encoding categorical variables** (e.g., transaction type, location).
- **Feature engineering**:
  - Transaction velocity (number of transactions within a short period).
  - Location change frequency.
  - Device switching frequency.

### 5.2 Machine Learning Models

| Model                                | Precision | Recall   | F1-Score | AUC-ROC  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression                  | 0.62      | 0.45     | 0.52     | 0.74     |
| Random Forest                        | **0.78**  | 0.71     | 0.74     | 0.86     |
| XGBoost                              | **0.82**  | **0.76** | **0.79** | **0.90** |
| Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection) | 0.68      | **0.83** | 0.74     | 0.81     |

**XGBoost achieved the highest precision and recall balance, making it the best-performing model for fraud detection.**
